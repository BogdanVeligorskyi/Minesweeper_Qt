# Minesweeper_Qt
Classic Minesweeper game created with the use of C++ programming language and Qt library
In the process of development Qt creator and C++ were used. Application has graphical interface.

Gameplay of this game looks like original Minesweeper. However, I decided to put unique elements to make my product a bit more interesting:
- results (after each successful game user enters his name, and result saves to file; you can see all results in special window);
- opportunity to choose number of mines and board size (note, that number of mines can`t be higher than 1/3 of square).

If you want to test this game, please, contact me. And I`ll provide you with all necessary files for executing application.
